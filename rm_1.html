                <br>
                <p>Formula 1 is the highest class of international auto racing for single-seater formula racing cars. It
                    is a sporting activity governed by the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA), where ten
                    teams, comprising of two drivers each compete on a series of races over a one-year period or season
                    to determine the ultimate driver and a constructor champion. F1 has been one of the premier forms of
                    racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950, and since then, a lot has changed in
                    terms of race and car development. With the new era of technology, all formula 1 teams now rely
                    heavily on data more than they rely on the actual driving techniques of their star drivers.</p>
                <br>
                <p>One of the simplest techniques to win a race is to go faster than anyone else; however, that is not
                    as simple as it sounds. Today, Formula 1 race is not just about stepping on the acceleration pedal,
                    steering the wheel, and winning a race, in fact, it has become much more than that. Speed, car
                    reliability, and tyre performance are the most important factors in a race and to achieve maximum of
                    that, huge amount of data is collected by many specialised sensors fitted on the cars and on the
                    racing pit. These sensors generate about 1 GB of raw data when the car hits a speed of 321 kph, and
                    with hundreds of sensors fitted on a single car, about 300 GB of raw data with millions of data
                    points are generated per race weekend. If we add this to the data generated by the rest of the team,
                    it can amount to 40–50 TB of data per race week.</p>
                <br>
                <p>World-renowned F1 teams, such as McLaren, Red Bull, Mercedes AMG, Ferrari all try to make the best
                    out of data analytics. These teams have deployed sensors to collect data reflecting many different
                    aspects of the car performance ranging from speed along various curves to tyre pressures to even
                    fuel burn, this recorded data is then transformed into predictive models in order to analyse and
                    compare with historical data such as speed of other cars and race predictions. These analysed inputs
                    are also delivered to engineers, so that they can develop a better car, with improved aerodynamics,
                    performance, and handling.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Formula 1 has seen very sophisticated levels of simulations in the last decade that even minute
                    details gone unseen can drastically change the course of the race. The best example to support this
                    statement is the 2012 Brazillian Grand Prix, Sebastian Vettel who then was already a two-time world
                    champion was dominating the 2012 season and he had to finish in the top three to win his third world
                    title. During the first lap of the race, his car was hit from behind and he was dropped to the last
                    position and it seemed that the hopes of winning the third title were drained. But the Red Bull
                    engineers immediately took the command, they checked every piece of data available, analysed it and
                    then few laps down the race they were fortunate enough to find the solution. Vettel was pitted and
                    solutions were implemented. Passing the checkered flag in the sixth position, he was able to score
                    the highest point of the season, securing him the third world title. The second best example is the
                    Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 team, they have used data-driven analytic insights and decision-making to
                    optimize execution at every opportunity, and this well has made them the ultimate team to beat. They
                    hold the record of the most consecutive constructors’ titles with seven between 2014 and 2020
                    season.</p>
                <br>
                <p>With a new era in Formula 1 approaching soon, the 2022 season will come with many unexpected
                    challenges for the teams, but one thing which is for sure is that data analytics will play a huge
                    role in overcoming these obstacles, and it will continue to make the sport better and more
                    competitive.</p>
